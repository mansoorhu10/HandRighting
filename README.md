# HandRighting
A Full-Stack Handwriting Application. Improve your handwriting,    

## How I worked on this project
My goal was to create a full-stack web application with simple handwriting functionality that amplifies the user experience with complex machine learning.
  * I worked with tasks on a Trello board to keep myself on track.
  * I built the app using C# and the ASP.NET MVC framework.

## What I have learned
I learned many valuable skills in web development using C# and ASP.NET.
  * I used C# and ASP.NET alongside my existing web development knowledge to understand how the different technologies interact with each other.
## Future Improvements
Once I have enough time to continue working on this project, these are the primary changes and improvements I will make to the web app:
  * Add Machine Learning to the project.
